I'm passionate about equipping researchers with the skills they need to achieve greater impact.

I plan, coordinate, and teach training workshops on programming, managing research data, and specialist research software. 

I advocate for openness and reproducibility in research, and maintain an interest in research policy.

I'm currently learning how to use {{< iconify fa6-brands:r-project >}} and Quarto {{< iconify simple-icons:quarto >}} to visualise and interpret data.
